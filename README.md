## Description

To be frank I am not a fan of "GenAI". The term is bloated and hyped to shit.
The impact it has on our environment is disgraceful. Yet just like plastic bags
companies are pushing this too. The implications this hype bubble
will have on the global economy is disastrous when it pops. Overall, it is a
net negative for our trust in information and ability to learn. The exploration
of women with it is sickening. Granted that is more a societal issue. We should
be better people.

So why do this? My craft is a technologist. My job is to evaluate pros and cons.
I cannot escape a day without it being brought up at work as a productivity multiplier.
Yet no one seems to use it or know how it will do that. Either, I can find a real
workflow or I can disprove the hype.

## Goal

Using /data provide examples.
Build out specs for json schema and openapi specs.
Generate the code
Build out the logic.
Add in observability.

Testing and CI/CD

Breaking change idea is to move it to a multi-project module system.
Add in a protobuffs for a persistence service.
Add Docker.

Bring in golang for a TUI using the protobuff.

Seems like an average work project.

## Tools

- neovim because no this is not "vibe coded". Production application cannot be.
- Supermaven as a copilot. Still do not like these things.
- open-code the real one https://github.com/sst/opencode
- openrouter https://openrouter.ai to try out different models.
